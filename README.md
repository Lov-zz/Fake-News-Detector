# Fake News Detection with Logistic Regression

## Project Overview
This project implements a logistic regression model to detect fake news. The dataset used contains political and world news articles, categorized as real or fake.

## Features
- Data preprocessing using TF-IDF vectorization
- Logistic regression model implemented with PyTorch
- Training and testing scripts
- Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

## Results
The model's loss decreases steadily over epochs, indicating good convergence.
